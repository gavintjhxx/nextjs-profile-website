After about 2 years, I was officially certified as a Verified Discord Bot Developer (now known as Early Verified Bot Developer). As I had the option to select elective subjects/modules in Upper Secondary (Grade 10-11), I took up computing and eventually learned Python, which was much easier than Javascript, definitely. Along the way, I developed several versions of my personal website (the one you‚Äôre currently reading is the 4th edition, 2nd revision) and learnt a lot about web security. Eventually, I got intrigued by the stereotypical thoughts of ‚Äúhacking‚Äù and decided it was something worth checking out."

It‚Äôs still pretty fun nonetheless, and it‚Äôs also an increasingly crucial aspect of our digital lives as time passes."
